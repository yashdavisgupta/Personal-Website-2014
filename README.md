# Personal-Website-2014
This is an upload of a personal website I made in 2014. This was never mean't to be a resume website, it was only made to test the limits of Jquery, Html5, CSS3, and the bootstrap framework as well as the google maps api.

Hopefully Somebody can find something useful to do with it.
